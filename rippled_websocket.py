Code by rabbit:

This script provides an example/template using python3 to connect to a rippled
node via websocket (WS). WS must also be configured in the node's rippled.cfg file.
This script uses the 'websocket' module, which is available via pip.
This script is based on this example: https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client

This is offered 'as is'. Users will likely need to modify the script to meet their
individual needs.

Subscriptions provide ongoing information on the XRP ledger's state, including transactions.
One use for this script is monitoring transaction flows or other data from the ledger.
